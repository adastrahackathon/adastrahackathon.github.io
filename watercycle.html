        <a id="info1">Water can be found all over Earth in the ocean, on land and in the atmosphere. The water cycle is the path that all water follows as it moves around our planet.        </a>

        <a id="info2">On Earth, you can find water in all three states of matter: solid, liquid and gas. Liquid water is found in Earth’s oceans, rivers, lakes, streams—and even in the soil and underground. Solid ice is found in glaciers, snow, and at the North and South Poles. Water vapor—a gas—is found in Earth’s atmosphere.

        How does water travel from a glacier to the ocean to a cloud? That’s where the water cycle comes in.</a>

        <a id="info3"><strong>1.Evaporation</strong></stroEvaporation> is the phase where water changes from a liquid to a gas. When the Sun heats water sources like oceans, lakes, and the water in soil, snow, and ice (sublimation, solid to gas), it gains energy and turns into gas. This water vapor rises into the sky and forms clouds.
            <strong>2.Condensation</strong> is the process where water changes from a gaseous state to a liquid. It occurs when air holds too much water vapor, which depends on temperature. The excess water vapor then undergoes precipitation.
            <strong>3.Precipitation</strong> is when water droplets or ice crystals in clouds combine and fall to the ground as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. This water eventually spreads around the territory and returns to the evaporation process, completing the water cycle.

            Why Do We Care About the Water Cycle?
We care about the water cycle because water is necessary for all living things. NASA satellites orbiting Earth right now are helping us to understand what is happening with water on our planet.

Water in the Soil

Humans need water to drink, and to water the plants that grow our food. NASA has a satellite called SMAP—short for Soil Moisture Active Passive—that measures how much water is in the top 2 inches (5 cm) of Earth’s soil. This can help us understand the relationship between water in the soil and severe weather conditions, such as droughts.

Water in the Atmosphere

NASA’s CloudSat mission studies water in our atmosphere in the form of clouds. CloudSat gathers information about clouds and how they play a role in Earth’s climate. Also, the international satellite called the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM) observes when, where and how much it rains and snows on Earth.

Water in the Oceans

As Earth’s climate becomes warmer, land ice at the North and South Poles starts melting. The water then flows into the ocean, causing sea level to rise. NASA’s Jason-3 mission—short for Joint Altimetry Satellite Oceanography Network-3—orbits Earth collecting information about sea level and ocean temperature. This helps track how the ocean responds to Earth’s changing climate.

NASA is also tracking how Earth’s water moves all around our planet. This is the work of the GRACE-FO—or Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment-Follow On—mission. It tracks the movement of water from one month to the next, and can even measure changes in deep groundwater hundreds of feet below Earth’s surface.

NASA’s Aqua satellite also collects a large amount of information about Earth’s water cycle, including water in the oceans, clouds, sea ice, land ice and snow cover.
